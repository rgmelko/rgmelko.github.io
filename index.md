## Computing the world of quantum matter

We perform research on strongly correlated quantum many-body systems, with an emphasis on computational methods as a theoretical technique. 
Our work includes the development of state-of-the-art algorithms and codes for the study of quantum matter, materials and devices.
We are also interested in broader ideas in computational physics, the theory of efficient simulations of quantum mechanics on classical computers, and its relationship to the field of quantum information science.

### Research Interests
- Entanglement in condensed matter
- Machine learning in quantum physics
- Unconventional quantum phase transitions
- Frustrated quantum magnetism
- Novel numerical techniques
